# Dice Roller APP

I am following the [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course) pathway and I created this app.

Dice Roller is an android app where users can click a Button in the app to roll a dice. The outcome of the roll will be shown in a TextView on the screen.

The app opens on a blank screen with a button to roll the dice for the first time.

Once you click on the button the dice appears with a random number.You can click on the button again for a new outcome.
